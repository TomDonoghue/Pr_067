    "The question is of interest because it will help us better speculate what players to keep an eye on, and whether NBA rookie statistics can be extrapolated to analyse when a rookie will breakout. Personal background includes our experience as being fans of the sport of basketball and our support for the NBA. We have watched more than five seasons of basketball and have witnessed rookies reach a breakout. We have absorbed knowledge from analysts and other sports media that makes us believe, with our experience, we feel confident in predicting rookie breakout in 4-6 years. By analyzing the statistics of NBA players, we can begin to see how the game of basketball has changed over the years and how statistics have changed. \n",

    "- This project obviously cannot  accurately measure the potential breakout season of every shooting guard. Off the field issues, intangibles, organization, and many more factors are to be  taken account when judging a player’s skill. Stats cannot and will never tell the whole story. The data we’re using is all about the player’s past performances, and using them to predict future play, however external events, eg. injury, can affect the player’s growth and eventual outbreak. However, we  would be unable to predict the occurrence of such developments, and so we will not be taking them into account in our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are no biases in the data sources at all since the the statistics are hard numbers over the course of many games. Because we're weighing some stats more than others, a player's efficiency rating might not even truly be indicative of when a player is in their prime. This leads back to the idea that stats don't tell the whole story. The only statistic with any level of bias is efficiency rating. This stat was created by the NBA as an algorithm to calculate a player’s performance based on multiple measurements. We are using this statistic as a comparison and believe it is still very accurate.\n",

    "- If we do  encounter errors in our methods, then we will try to understand why our previous assumptions were incorrect, and try to correct how we interpret the data. Because we are determining when a player reaches his “prime,” an incorrect hypothesis would not be  all too devastating. A player could have an  incredible  efficiency rating and amazing statistics, but could  still be overshadowed by  other players on his team. We’re  attempting to transform a  viewer experience into numbers that measure a player, which is unreasonable. "
